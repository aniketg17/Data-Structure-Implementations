# Data Structure Implementations
This repository has my own attempts at implementing standard data structures.

## Motivation
The purpose behind these was to prepare myself for my upcoming 'Data Structures and Algorithms' class. By being able to implement these manually, I wanted to get adept at recognizing when to use which data structure based on their internal workings and strengths. Not to mention, implementing these structures helps you understand the different, creative ways of looking at the same problems. 

## Implementations

1. Hashmap
2. Stack
3. Queue
4. Deque
5. Heap
6. Binary Search Tree
7. AVL Tree
8. Trie
9. Additional Exception classes
